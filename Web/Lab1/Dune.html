    <p><em>"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my<br>
            fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to<br>
            see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."</em></p>
